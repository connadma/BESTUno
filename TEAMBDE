     * play - This method is called when it's your turn and you need to
     * choose what card to play.
     * <p>
     * The hand parameter tells you what's in your hand. You can call
     * getColor(), getRank(), and getNumber() on each of the cards it
     * contains to see what it is. The color will be the color of the card,
     * or "Color.NONE" if the card is a wild card. The rank will be
     * "Rank.NUMBER" for all numbered cards, and another value (e.g.,
     * "Rank.SKIP," "Rank.REVERSE," etc.) for special cards. The value of
     * a card's "number" only has meaning if it is a number card.
     * (Otherwise, it will be -1.)
     * <p>
     * The upCard parameter works the same way, and tells you what the
     * up card (in the middle of the table) is.
     * <p>
     * The calledColor parameter only has meaning if the up card is a wild,
     * and tells you what color the player who played that wild card called.
     * <p>
     * Finally, the state parameter is a GameState object on which you can
     * invoke methods if you choose to access certain detailed information
     * about the game (like who is currently ahead, what colors each player
     * has recently called, etc.)
     * <p>
     * You must return a value from this method indicating which card you
     * wish to play. If you return a number 0 or greater, that means you
     * want to play the card at that index. If you return -1, that means
     * that you cannot play any of your cards (none of them are legal plays)
     * in which case you will be forced to draw a card (this will happen
     * automatically for you.)
